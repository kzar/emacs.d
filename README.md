## Intro

My personal Emacs configuration. Mostly here for my own convenience although feel free to have a poke around.

 - [railwaycat/emacs-mac-port](https://github.com/railwaycat/emacs-mac-port) - The best Emacs port for Mac that I've found.
 - [Aaron Bedra's Emacs configuration](http://www.aaronbedra.com/emacs.d/) - A much more comprehensive, better written and documented example of an Emacs configuration. (Some bits in my configuration are from this.)
 - [Declaring .emacs bankruptcy](http://emacsblog.org/2007/10/07/declaring-emacs-bankruptcy/) - Good post that inspired me to sort out and share my Emacs configuration. Previously I had one large .emacs file and a bunch of random .el files scattered around my system!
